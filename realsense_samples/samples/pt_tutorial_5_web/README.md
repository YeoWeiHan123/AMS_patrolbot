#pt_tutorial_5_web

This GUI app builds on top of pt_tutorial_5 and displays the live color preview from the camera within a browser and draw rectangles around the person(s) detected in the camera frame and draws a color dot indicating the center of mass for the detected person in the image. Mouse click in any of the rectangle activates tracking for that person. To stop tracking, click outside the rectangle of the person who is being tracked. There is also a table as part of the GUI that shows the person id, center of mass world coordinates(x,y,z) and the cumulative count of persons detected. When the person moves out of frame, tracking on the person works for a few seconds. Once the tracking module loses track of the person it was tracking, it goes back to the person detection mode.
