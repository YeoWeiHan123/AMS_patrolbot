#pt_tutorial_2

This sample app demonstrates how to analyze someoneâ€™s posture. When a person is in the field of view (FOV), the app should display the following information once every second: head direction (yaw, pitch, roll values).

# Sample output

When running the pt_tutorial_2 sample, person ID (PID), and head pose values (yaw, pitch, roll) will be printed on the console continuously.

```
PID: 0, head pose (pitch, roll, yaw) (-7.50198, -11.7497, 1.65109)
 orientation: frontal, confidence: 100
PID: 0, head pose (pitch, roll, yaw) (-6.33085, -11.9885, 3.56357)
 orientation: frontal, confidence: 100
PID: 0, head pose (pitch, roll, yaw) (-7.16278, -12.8903, 1.13986)
 orientation: frontal, confidence: 100
PID: 0, head pose (pitch, roll, yaw) (-7.34624, -14.0557, -0.528061)
```
